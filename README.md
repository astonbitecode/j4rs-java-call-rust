## j4rs: Java -> Rust direction examples

Before v0.12.0, `j4rs` focused only for calling Java code from Rust (Rust -> Java direction). In v0.12.0 though, Java -> Rust direction is being implemented.

This repository contains examples of using `j4rs` in the Java world to call Rust functions.

Basically the whole implementation is done using [attribute-like macros](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html#attribute-like-macros).
